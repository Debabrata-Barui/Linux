** What are the basic components of Linux?
=> Basic components of Linux

Kernel: It is the core component of Linux, it acts as an interface between software and hardware. 
	Linux kernel is the heart of the operating system. It acts as a bridge between software and hardware. If Software requests the hardware, then the kernel delivers the data between software and hardware.
 
Shell: It acts as an interface between the user and the Kernel.
GUI:  It stands for Graphic User Interface, which is another way for the user to interact with the system. But it is unlike images, buttons, text boxes for interaction.
System Utilities: These are the software functions that allow users to manage the computer.
Application Programs: Set of functions designed to perform a set of tasks.

** There are two types of Interface to communication -
1. CUI( Character User Interface)
2. GUI(Graphical User Interface)

** Linux File System
A Linux file system is a structured collection of files on a disk drive or a partition. A partition is a segment of memory and contains some specific data. In our machine, there can be various partitions of the memory. Generally, every partition contains a file system.

The Linux file system contains the following sections:-->
The root directory (/)
A specific data storage format (EXT3, EXT4, BTRFS, XFS and so on)
A partition or logical volume having a particular file system.


**  What is BASH?
Ans: Bash is a Unix shell and command processor written by Brian Fox for the GNU project. It is free software and acts as a replacement for Bourne Shell. It is an interpreted and not compiled process which can also be run in the terminal window.

This allows users to write commands and cause actions. Bash is capable of reading commands from shell scripts.

** How many types of Shells are there in Linux? 
They are five Shells in Linux:

C Shell (csh): It is like C syntax and provides spelling checking and job control.
Korn Shell (ksh): This is a high-level programming language shell.
Z Shell (Zsh): It provides some unique nature like it observes login/logout watching, file name generating, startup files, closing comments. 
Bourne Again Shell (bash): It is the default to Linux distributions.
Friendly Interactive Shell (Fish): It provides web-based configuration,  auto-suggestions, etc.

** How do you open a command prompt when issuing a command?
Launch your terminal by pressing CTRL+ALT+T or by giving terminal in the menu search bar.

** What is a swap space?
=> It acts as a Virtual Memory pr RAM.
Swap Space is used when then physical Ram memory is running out. It will move the Ram inactive pages to the swap space. It can consider in the form of a dedicated swap partition or swap files.

**  What is LILO?
LILO means Linux Loader is a boot loader that is used for the Linux operating system. Most of the Linux Operating systems use LILO, to boot the operating system into main memory to start the operations.

** What is CLI?
CLI means Command language Interpreter. 

** Explain File Permissions types in Linux?
Linux file permissions - Each file or directory has 3 permissions

They are 

Read: It refers to that only they can read the file.
Write: It refers that they can write the file or modify the file of a directory.
Execute: It affects the user’s capability to execute the file or to view the file of a directory. 

** What are the environmental variables?
They are dynamic values that affect the process of programs on a computer. They exist in every operating system and their types may vary. They can be created, edited, saved, and deleted and they also give information about the system behavior.

** How to set the ENVIRONMENT Variable on CentOS 7?
=> # cd ~ ==> To go to the /root
   # vim .bash_profile
   	NAME="Debabrata Barui"
	export NAME
   # source ~/.bash_profile ==> To reload your profile
   # echo $NAME


** What are the symbolic links? 
It will be redirected to another file using its path. Target files do not contain any data. Symbolic links redirect to another entry somewhere in the file system. If the target file is deleted, the link to that file is removed, but not the file.
There are two types of Symbolic Link- 
1. Soft Link- 
# ln -s file1 softlinkFile1 -- To create shoutcut of a directory and file also.

2. Hard Link- It is used to backup. It is use on only file not for Directory.*
# ln file1 backupFile1 

**  What is redirection?
Redirection can be defined as changing the standard input and output devices. To redirect metacharacters are used, you can redirect the file or program. 

** What are Daemons?
A Daemons is a background process that accepts the requests for service from other computers, most of the operating systems use daemons in other forms.  

** Describe the root account?
The root is the user name, that default has access to all files and commands. The root user can do many things, but an ordinary user cannot do like installing software, changing file permissions, etc.

** Explain the virtual desktop?
Virtual Desktop is a user interface when you are facing the problem of how to manage multiple windows on your desktop, virtual desktop serves as an alternative. Virtual desktop stores remote server and allow you to use one or more programs on a clean slate. 

** What are inode and process id?
The inode is a unique name given to each file and the process id is a unique id/name given to each process.

** What are the Process states in Linux?
Five process states in Linux. They are

New/ Ready: A new process is created and ready to run.
Running: The process is being executed.
Blocked/ Wait: The process is waiting for input from the user. 
Terminated/ Completed: The process completed the execution or terminated by the operating system. 
Zombie: The process is deleted, but still the information regarding the process exists in the process table.

** Explain Process Management System Calls in Linux?
The process management system calls in Linux:

fork(): Used to create a new process.
exec(): Execute new process.
wait(): wait until process execution.
exit(): exit from the process.
System calls to get the Process id :

getpid(): to find the unique process id. 
getppid(): to find the unique parent process id. 

** Create a process in CentOS.
=> Install C Compiler
# yum install gcc -y
# vim Process.c

#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <stdio.h>
void main( )
{
   pid_t child_pid;
   child_pid = fork (); // Create a new child process;
   if (child_pid < 0)
   {
      printf("fork failed");
      return 1;
   }
   else if (child_pid == 0)
   {
      printf ("child process successfully created!\n");
      printf ("child_PID = %d,parent_PID = %d\n",
      getpid(), getppid() );
   }
   else
   {
      wait(NULL);
      printf ("parent process successfully created!\n");
      printf ("child_PID = %d, parent_PID = %d", getpid(), getppid() );
   }
   return 0;
}

=> To Execute the C process
# gcc -o Process Process.c
# ./Process

** Explain File Permission groups in Linux?
There are three user-based permission groups for each file and directory.

They are:

Owner: Owners only will have to access the file or directory, they will not impact the actions of other users.
Group: These permissions apply only to the group, that has been assigned to the file or directory. They will not impact the actions of other users.
All Users: These permissions are applied to all users on the system.


** What Is a File system in Linux?
Linux file system stores and handles the data. Without a file system, it cannot know where the file starts from and where the file ends.

** Explain different file system types in Linux?
In Linux, there are many file systems:

Ext, Ext2, Ext3, Ext4, JFS, XFS, btrfs, ufs, autofs, devpts, ntfs and swap.

** Why LVM is required?
LVM stands for Large Volume Management, it is a storage management device. Users can create, resize, and delete LVM partitions. It increases abstraction, flexibility, and control. LVM is used to gather existing storage devices into the group and allocate logical units. 

** fdisk command -->
# df -h
# lsblk ==> Show the disk partition
# fdisk /dev/sda ==> create a new Partiton using fdisk tool and select partition type LVM 
# partprobe
# pvcreate /dev/sda1



** What is umask?
umask stands for user file creation mode. When the user creates any file, it has default file permissions. So umask will specify few restrictions to the newly created file (it controls the file permissions).

umask [-S] [mask]


** How to set the mask permanently for a user? 
If the umask command invoked without any arguments, it means it will display the current mask. 

To set the unmask permanently, we have two types.

They are:

Ocotal representation.
Symbolic representation.

**  What is network bonding in Linux?
Network Bonding is a process of combining more than two network interfaces to form a single network interface. It offers performance improvement and redundancy by increasing network throughput and bandwidth.

No need to worry if one interface is down or unplugged because the other will work. The behaviour of the bonded interface depends on the bonding method. 

** What are the different modes of Network bonding in Linux?
Different modes of Linux network bonding

Mode-0(balance-rr): It is a default mode and based on Round-Robin policy. It offers fault tolerance and load balancing features. It used round-robin fashion to transmit the packets.
Mode-1(active-backup): It is based on Active Backup policy and only one slave will act in the band and another one will act when the others fail in the band. It also provides fault tolerance.
Mode-2(balance-xor): It sets a xor mode between the source Mac address and destination Mac address to provide fault tolerance.
Mode-3(broadcast): It is based on broadcast policy and transmitted everything in the slave interface. It also provides fault tolerance and can be used only for a particular purpose.
Mode-4(802.3ad): It is a dynamic aggregation mode, it created aggregation groups which is having the same speed. It uses the transmit hashing method to select the slaves for outgoing traffic.
Mode-5(balance-tlb): The outgoing traffic is according to the current load on the slave, and the incoming traffic is received by the slave. It is called an adaptive transmit load balancing mode. 
Mode-6(balance-alb): It is an adaptive load balancing mode. It does not require any switch support. 

** How to check the default route and routing table?
To display the default route and routing table, we use the following commands.

$ route-n

$ nestat-rn

$ ip 

** How to check which ports are listening in my Linux Server?
We have two commands to check which ports are in listening in Linux Server. Following are the two commands 

# netstat --listen
# netstat -l

here the kernel modules are located?
lib/modules/kernel-version/, this directory stores all the information about the compiled drives under the Linux system. Using lsmod command also we can see the installed kernel modules. 

**  How to change the default run level in Linux?
To change the default run level in Linux use the init command. 

** How to share a directory using NFS?
- Network File System(NFS) is a distributed file system protocol, to share the files and folders between the Linux/Unix systems.
To share a directory using NFS, first edit the configuration file and ‘/etc/exports’ and add an entry like directory name ‘/<directory-name>’. Now restart the NFS service.

** How to Configure NFS on CentOS 7?
# wget http://rpmfind.net/linux/centos/7.9.2009/os/x86_64/Packages/nfs-utils-1.3.0-0.68.el7.x86_64.rpm
# yum install nfs-utils-1.3.0-0.68.el7.x86_64.rpm



** How to search the file?
# rpm -qa | grep nfs-utils

** GNOME (GNU Network Object Model Environment) --- 
-------------------------------------------------------
GNOME stands for GNU Object Model Environment. Properly pronounced “guh-nome,” it is one of the most popular free and open-source desktop environments used in some of the major Linux operating systems like Ubuntu, Pop!_OS,CentOS, Fedora, etc.

In simple terms, a Linux desktop environment is everything you see on your screen. From lock screen to home screen, as well as individual elements like app launchers and app icons, when tied together, form a desktop environment.
Linux typically provides two GUIs, KDE and Gnome.

** Linux OS = Linux Karnel + GNU
** GNU => GNU was a free sofware system movment in 1983. It was a project which was provide free software.
	GNU Stands for GNU stands for “GNU's Not Unix.”. It is collecion of free sofware. 
** Becally Linux is a Karnel after join with JNU it became a Operating System.

** There are many companys in the market who redesigned to Linux --
1. RHEL - Red Hat Enterprise Linix 
2. Fedora Group
3. Debian
4. Other - Ubuntu, CentOS(Community Enterprise Operating System), Amazon Linux, Kali Linux


** Differentiate between BASH and DOS?
Difference between Bash and Dos
Bash - 
Commands are case sensitive
Backward slash(/) represents directories separator
Forward slash ‘’ represents escape character
Does not follow naming conventions in files 

Dos-
commands are not case sensitive
‘/’ represents command arguments
‘’ represents directories separator
Follow naming convention in files

** What is meant by internal commands and external commands?
Internal Commands: Commands directly run by the shell are known as internal commands and there is no separate process to run the commands. 
External Commands: Commands which are run by the kernel are known as external commands and every single command has its own unique process id.

** Explain the work of the Ctrl+Alt+Del key combination on the Linux operating system?
In Linux, the Ctrl+Alt+Del key is used to restart the computer, and it does not display any confirmation message before rebooting the system. 

** What is the netstat command in Linux?
netstat command in Linux shows the network status. This netstat command shows network ports in use and their incoming connections.


** What is the df command in Linux?
Users can use the df command to troubleshoot disk space issues. Here df stands for display free disk space.

df Command Example:

df -h

** What is a du command in Linux?
du command in Linux is used to retrieve more detailed information about which files use the disk space in a directory.

du Command Example:

$ du -sh /var/log/*
1.8M  /var/log/anaconda
384K  /var/log/audit
4.0K  /var/log/boot.log
0 /var/log/chrony
4.0K  /var/log/cron
4.0K  /var/log/maillog
64K /var/log/messages

** What is the iptables command in Linux?
iptables command blocks or allows traffic on a Linux host, similar to a network firewall. This iptables command may prevent certain applications from receiving or transmitting requests.

** What is the difference between Linux and Windows?
=>
Linux ==>
Linux is available for FREE
It is an Open-Source operating system
Linux customization is possible
It provides high-level security
Primary partitioning and logical partitioning available to boot
BackSlash separates directories
File names are case particular

Windows ==>
It is paid software
It is not an open-source OS
No customizations are available
Can't defend virus and malware attacks unless until it is paid
Booting available while primary partitioning only
The forward slash separates directories
Irrespective of the case while naming files

** What is df -h command?
This command shows free space on mounted file systems.

** What is df -i command?
df -I command shows free inodes on mounted filesystems.

** What is fdisk -l command used for?
fdisk -I command show disks partitions sizes and types (run as root)

**  How do you kill the program using one port in Linux?
Use this command to kills the program using one port: sudo fuser -k 8000/tcp


** Key differences between CentOS and Red Hat Enterprise Linux OS
=> Here, you will learn about the various key differences between CentOS and Red Hat OS. Some main differences between CentOS and Red Hat OS are as follows:

CentOS is a manageable, predictable, stable, and reproducible platform derived from RHEL sources. In contrast, RHEL is a commercial Linux distribution.
CentOS is developed for the amd64 platform. In contrast, Red Hat OS is developed for the ARM 64, IBM Power, IBM Z, x86-64, Power ISA, and IBM LinuxOne platforms.
The open-source community maintains CentOS. In contrast, Red Hat OS is maintained by the Red Hat organization.
CentOS was firstly launched in 2004. In contrast, Red Hat was firstly launched in 2000.
CentOS applications include mainframes, desktop PCs, workstations, and servers. In contrast, Red Hat applications include workstations, servers, mainframes, and supercomputers.
Yum, Package Kit, and rpm are CentOS package managers. In contrast, Red Hat's package managers are Yum, yumex, PackageKit, and RPM.
CentOS is similar to Red Hat; it is free and does not have official support. On the other hand, Red Hat offers subscription-based services as well as official support.
CentOS is preferred for personal use. In contrast, Red Hat is preferred for organizational use.

** DNF (Dandified YUM) VS YUM (Yellowdog Updater, Modified)
=> DNF uses ‘libsolv’ for dependency resolution, developed and maintained by SUSE. YUM uses the public API for dependency resolution

=> API is fully documented. API is not fully documented
=> It is written in C, C++, Python. It is written only in Python
=> DNF is currently used in Fedora, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 (RHEL), CentOS 8, OEL 8 and Mageia 6/7.  YUM is currently used in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6/7 (RHEL), CentOS 6/7, OEL 6/7.
=> DNf supports various extensions. Yum supports only Python-based extension
=> The API is well documented so it’s easy to create new features. It is very difficult to create new features because the API is not properly documented.
=> The DNF uses less memory when synchronizing the metadata of the repositories.  The YUM uses excessive memory when synchronizing the metadata of the repositories.
=> If the enabled repository does not respond, dnf will skip it and continue the transaction with the available repositories. If a repository is not available, YUM will stop immediately.
=> dnf update and dnf upgrade are equals. It’s different in yum
=> Kernel packages are not protected by dnf. Unlike Yum, you can delete all kernel packages, including one that runs. 	Yum will not allow you to remove the running kernel

************************************************

** ** ps command in Linux ==>
As we all know Linux is a multitasking and multi-user systems. So, it allows multiple processes to operate simultaneously without interfering with each other. Process is one of the important fundamental concept of the Linux OS. A process is an executing instance of a program and carry out different tasks within the operating system. 

Linux provides us a utility called ps for viewing information related with the processes on a system which stands as abbreviation for “Process Status”. ps command is used to list the currently running processes and their PIDs along with some other information depends on different options. It reads the process information from the virtual files in /proc file-system. /proc contains virtual files, this is the reason it’s referred as a virtual file system. 

** top ==> top command is used to show the Linux processes. It provides a dynamic real-time view of the running system. Usually, this command shows the summary information of the system and the list of processes or threads which are currently managed by the Linux Kernel.


** Top vs Ps Command ==>
ps - (Process Status) - It reports a snapshot of current processes.
top (Table Of Processes) -It is a task manager program displays information about CPU and memory utilization.It provides a dynamic real-time view of the running system.

** How to kill the process in CentOS 7
# ps ==> Reports shell processes status
# top
# ps -elf ==> To display the running process in the terminal
# ps -elf |grep test1 ==> It finds the particular process which is running on the background .
# kill <process_id> ==> It is used to kill the process
Ex-
	# vim test1
	# ps -elf
	# ps -elf |grep test*

	0 S centos    2874  2758  0  80   0 - 37328 poll_s 04:05 pts/0    00:00:00 vim test1
	0 R centos    3016  2878  0  80   0 - 28203 -      04:10 pts/2    00:00:00 grep --color=auto test1

		
	# kill 2874
	Vim: Caught deadly signal TERM
	Vim: Finished.

	Terminated


** What is Package Manager ?
=> Package manager or package management system is a collection of software tools that automate the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing software in the Linux system.

Each Linux distribution uses different package management tools, while the Red Hat-based distros use RPM, YUM and DNF.

** What’s RPM?
RPM refers to RPM Package Manager (formerly known as Red Hat Package Manager) is a powerful, command-line package management tool developed for the Red Hat operating system.
It is now used as a core component in many Linux distributions such as Centos, Fedora, Oracle Linux, openSUSE and Mageia.
RPM Package Manager allows you to install, upgrade, delete, query and verify packages on RPM-based Linux systems.
RPM files comes with the .rpm extension. 
There are many front-end tools available on Linux to install the RPM package that make the installation process efficient, compared to the RPM tool, especially for handling dependencies.
 A Graphical frontend tool for Linux Package Manager -- YUM, DNF, apt-get, apt, urpmi, pacman, yaourt, packer & zypper.

** What’s YUM?
YUM stands for Yellowdog Updater Modified.
Yum is a free and open-source command-line package-management application/tool for Linux operating systems that uses the RPM Package Manager.

Yum is a front-end tool for rpm that automatically solves dependencies for packages.

It installs RPM software packages from distribution official repositories and other third-party repositories.

Yum allows you to install, update, search and remove packages from your system.

If you want to keep your system up-to-date, you can enable automatic updates via yum-cron.

Also, if needed, it allows you to exclude a package or packages from the yum update.

Yum is installed by default and you do not need to install it seperately.


** What is the different between Unix and Linux ?
=> Linux ==>
   -----------
- Linux is open source and is developed by Linux community of developers.
- Linux is free to use.
- Supportd File systems -- Ext2, Ext3, Ext4, Jfs, ReiserFS, Xfs, Btrfs, FAT, FAT32, NTFS.

- Linux is used in wide varieties from desktop, servers, smartphones to mainframes.
- Bash (Bourne Again SHell) is default shell for Linux.
- Ex- Ubuntu,Fedora ,CentOS, RedHat, Debian GNU, Arch Linux, etc.

Unix ==>
---------
- Unix was developed by AT&T Bell labs and is not open source.
- Unix is licensed OS.
- Supportd File systems-- fs, gpfs, hfs, hfs+, ufs, xfs, zfs.
- Unix was initially a command based OS. Most of the unix distributions now have Gnome.
- Unix is mostly used on servers, workstations or PCs.
- Bourne Shell is default shell for Unix.
- Ex- SunOS, Solaris, SCO UNIX, AIX, HP/UX, ULTRIX etc.
