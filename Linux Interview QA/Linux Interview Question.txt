** What are the basic components of Linux?
=> Basic components of Linux

Kernel: It is the core component of Linux, it acts as an interface between software and hardware. 
	Linux kernel is the heart of the operating system. It acts as a bridge between software and hardware. If Software requests the hardware, then the kernel delivers the data between software and hardware.
 
Shell: It acts as an interface between the user and the Kernel.
GUI:  It stands for Graphic User Interface, which is another way for the user to interact with the system. But it is unlike images, buttons, text boxes for interaction.
System Utilities: These are the software functions that allow users to manage the computer.
Application Programs: Set of functions designed to perform a set of tasks.

** There are two types of Interface to communication -
1. CUI( Character User Interface)
2. GUI(Graphical User Interface)

** Linux File System
A Linux file system is a structured collection of files on a disk drive or a partition. A partition is a segment of memory and contains some specific data. In our machine, there can be various partitions of the memory. Generally, every partition contains a file system.

The Linux file system contains the following sections:-->
The root directory (/)
A specific data storage format (EXT3, EXT4, BTRFS, XFS and so on)
A partition or logical volume having a particular file system.


**  What is BASH?
Ans: Bash is a Unix shell and command processor written by Brian Fox for the GNU project. It is free software and acts as a replacement for Bourne Shell. It is an interpreted and not compiled process which can also be run in the terminal window.

This allows users to write commands and cause actions. Bash is capable of reading commands from shell scripts.

** How many types of Shells are there in Linux? 
They are five Shells in Linux:

C Shell (csh): It is like C syntax and provides spelling checking and job control.
Korn Shell (ksh): This is a high-level programming language shell.
Z Shell (Zsh): It provides some unique nature like it observes login/logout watching, file name generating, startup files, closing comments. 
Bourne Again Shell (bash): It is the default to Linux distributions.
Friendly Interactive Shell (Fish): It provides web-based configuration,  auto-suggestions, etc.

** How do you open a command prompt when issuing a command?
Launch your terminal by pressing CTRL+ALT+T or by giving terminal in the menu search bar.

** What is a swap space?
=> It acts as a Virtual Memory pr RAM.
Swap Space is used when then physical Ram memory is running out. It will move the Ram inactive pages to the swap space. It can consider in the form of a dedicated swap partition or swap files.

**  What is LILO?
LILO means Linux Loader is a boot loader that is used for the Linux operating system. Most of the Linux Operating systems use LILO, to boot the operating system into main memory to start the operations.

** What is CLI?
CLI means Command language Interpreter. 

** Explain File Permissions types in Linux?
Linux file permissions - Each file or directory has 3 permissions

They are 

Read: It refers to that only they can read the file.
Write: It refers that they can write the file or modify the file of a directory.
Execute: It affects the user’s capability to execute the file or to view the file of a directory. 

** What are the environmental variables?
They are dynamic values that affect the process of programs on a computer. They exist in every operating system and their types may vary. They can be created, edited, saved, and deleted and they also give information about the system behavior.

** How to set the ENVIRONMENT Variable on CentOS 7?
=> # cd ~ ==> To go to the /root
   # vim .bash_profile
   	NAME="Debabrata Barui"
	export NAME
   # source ~/.bash_profile ==> To reload your profile
   # echo $NAME


** What are the symbolic links? 
It will be redirected to another file using its path. Target files do not contain any data. Symbolic links redirect to another entry somewhere in the file system. If the target file is deleted, the link to that file is removed, but not the file.
There are two types of Symbolic Link- 
1. Soft Link- 
# ln -s file1 softlinkFile1 -- To create shoutcut of a directory and file also.

2. Hard Link- It is used to backup. It is use on only file not for Directory.*
# ln file1 backupFile1 

**  What is redirection?
Redirection can be defined as changing the standard input and output devices. To redirect metacharacters are used, you can redirect the file or program. 

** What are Daemons?
A Daemons is a background process that accepts the requests for service from other computers, most of the operating systems use daemons in other forms.  

** Describe the root account?
The root is the user name, that default has access to all files and commands. The root user can do many things, but an ordinary user cannot do like installing software, changing file permissions, etc.

** Explain the virtual desktop?
Virtual Desktop is a user interface when you are facing the problem of how to manage multiple windows on your desktop, virtual desktop serves as an alternative. Virtual desktop stores remote server and allow you to use one or more programs on a clean slate. 

** What are inode and process id?
The inode is a unique name given to each file and the process id is a unique id/name given to each process.

** What are the Process states in Linux?
Five process states in Linux. They are

New/ Ready: A new process is created and ready to run.
Running: The process is being executed.
Blocked/ Wait: The process is waiting for input from the user. 
Terminated/ Completed: The process completed the execution or terminated by the operating system. 
Zombie: The process is deleted, but still the information regarding the process exists in the process table.

** Explain Process Management System Calls in Linux?
The process management system calls in Linux:

fork(): Used to create a new process.
exec(): Execute new process.
wait(): wait until process execution.
exit(): exit from the process.
System calls to get the Process id :

getpid(): to find the unique process id. 
getppid(): to find the unique parent process id. 

** Create a process in CentOS.
=> Install C Compiler
# yum install gcc -y
# vim Process.c

#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <stdio.h>
void main( )
{
   pid_t child_pid;
   child_pid = fork (); // Create a new child process;
   if (child_pid < 0)
   {
      printf("fork failed");
      return 1;
   }
   else if (child_pid == 0)
   {
      printf ("child process successfully created!\n");
      printf ("child_PID = %d,parent_PID = %d\n",
      getpid(), getppid() );
   }
   else
   {
      wait(NULL);
      printf ("parent process successfully created!\n");
      printf ("child_PID = %d, parent_PID = %d", getpid(), getppid() );
   }
   return 0;
}

=> To Execute the C process
# gcc -o Process Process.c
# ./Process

** Explain File Permission groups in Linux?
There are three user-based permission groups for each file and directory.

They are:

Owner: Owners only will have to access the file or directory, they will not impact the actions of other users.
Group: These permissions apply only to the group, that has been assigned to the file or directory. They will not impact the actions of other users.
All Users: These permissions are applied to all users on the system.


** What Is a File system in Linux?
Linux file system stores and handles the data. Without a file system, it cannot know where the file starts from and where the file ends.

** Explain different file system types in Linux?
In Linux, there are many file systems:

Ext, Ext2, Ext3, Ext4, JFS, XFS, btrfs, ufs, autofs, devpts, ntfs and swap.

** Why LVM is required?
LVM stands for Large Volume Management, it is a storage management device. Users can create, resize, and delete LVM partitions. It increases abstraction, flexibility, and control. LVM is used to gather existing storage devices into the group and allocate logical units. 

** fdisk command -->
# df -h
# lsblk ==> Show the disk partition
# fdisk /dev/sda ==> create a new Partiton using fdisk tool and select partition type LVM 
# partprobe
# pvcreate /dev/sda1



** What is umask?
umask stands for user file creation mode. When the user creates any file, it has default file permissions. So umask will specify few restrictions to the newly created file (it controls the file permissions).

umask [-S] [mask]


** How to set the mask permanently for a user? 
If the umask command invoked without any arguments, it means it will display the current mask. 

To set the unmask permanently, we have two types.

They are:

Ocotal representation.
Symbolic representation.

**  What is network bonding in Linux?
Network Bonding is a process of combining more than two network interfaces to form a single network interface. It offers performance improvement and redundancy by increasing network throughput and bandwidth.

No need to worry if one interface is down or unplugged because the other will work. The behaviour of the bonded interface depends on the bonding method. 

** What are the different modes of Network bonding in Linux?
Different modes of Linux network bonding

Mode-0(balance-rr): It is a default mode and based on Round-Robin policy. It offers fault tolerance and load balancing features. It used round-robin fashion to transmit the packets.
Mode-1(active-backup): It is based on Active Backup policy and only one slave will act in the band and another one will act when the others fail in the band. It also provides fault tolerance.
Mode-2(balance-xor): It sets a xor mode between the source Mac address and destination Mac address to provide fault tolerance.
Mode-3(broadcast): It is based on broadcast policy and transmitted everything in the slave interface. It also provides fault tolerance and can be used only for a particular purpose.
Mode-4(802.3ad): It is a dynamic aggregation mode, it created aggregation groups which is having the same speed. It uses the transmit hashing method to select the slaves for outgoing traffic.
Mode-5(balance-tlb): The outgoing traffic is according to the current load on the slave, and the incoming traffic is received by the slave. It is called an adaptive transmit load balancing mode. 
Mode-6(balance-alb): It is an adaptive load balancing mode. It does not require any switch support. 

** How to check the default route and routing table?
To display the default route and routing table, we use the following commands.

$ route-n

$ nestat-rn

$ ip 

** How to check which ports are listening in my Linux Server?
We have two commands to check which ports are in listening in Linux Server. Following are the two commands 

# netstat --listen
# netstat -l

here the kernel modules are located?
lib/modules/kernel-version/, this directory stores all the information about the compiled drives under the Linux system. Using lsmod command also we can see the installed kernel modules. 

**  How to change the default run level in Linux?
To change the default run level in Linux use the init command. 

** How to share a directory using NFS?
- Network File System(NFS) is a distributed file system protocol, to share the files and folders between the Linux/Unix systems.
To share a directory using NFS, first edit the configuration file and ‘/etc/exports’ and add an entry like directory name ‘/<directory-name>’. Now restart the NFS service.

** How to Configure NFS on CentOS 7?
# wget http://rpmfind.net/linux/centos/7.9.2009/os/x86_64/Packages/nfs-utils-1.3.0-0.68.el7.x86_64.rpm
# yum install nfs-utils-1.3.0-0.68.el7.x86_64.rpm



** How to search the file?
# rpm -qa | grep nfs-utils

** GNOME (GNU Network Object Model Environment) --- 
-------------------------------------------------------
GNOME stands for GNU Object Model Environment. Properly pronounced “guh-nome,” it is one of the most popular free and open-source desktop environments used in some of the major Linux operating systems like Ubuntu, Pop!_OS,CentOS, Fedora, etc.

In simple terms, a Linux desktop environment is everything you see on your screen. From lock screen to home screen, as well as individual elements like app launchers and app icons, when tied together, form a desktop environment.

** Linux OS = Linux Karnel + GNU
** GNU => GNU was a free sofware system movment in 1983. It was a project which was provide free software.
	GNU Stands for GNU stands for “GNU's Not Unix.”. It is collecion of free sofware. 
** Becally Linux is a Karnel after join with JNU it became a Operating System.

** There are many companys in the market who redesigned to Linux --
1. RHEL - Red Hat Enterprise Linix 
2. Fedora Group
3. Debian
4. Other - Ubuntu, CentOS(Community Enterprise Operating System), Amazon Linux, Kali Linux
