master ,slave setup

The Jenkins master acts to schedule the jobs and assign slaves and send builds to slaves to execute the jobs. It will also monitor the slave state (offline or online) and getting back the build result responses from slaves and the display build results on the console output.

Steps :
1. Setup EC2 instance for slave
2. Create jenkins user and Install Java, Maven in Slave node
3. upload public keys from master to slave node.
4. verify ssh connection from master to slave
5. Register slave node in Jenkins master
6. Run build jobs in Jenkins slave
 
 you should use slave server
step1:
Updating packages in apt 
sudo apt update

step2:
Install Java

sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk

step3:

Create User as Jenkins
sudo useradd -m jenkins
sudo -u jenkins mkdir /home/jenkins/.ssh

step4: you should use master server

Add SSH Keys from Master to Slave 
Execute the below command in Jenkins master EC2.

use these command to create ssh
ssh-keygen

sudo cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

step5: you should use salve server
Now Login to Slave node and execute the below command

sudo -u jenkins vi /home/jenkins/.ssh/authorized_keys

step6: you should master server
Now go into master node

ssh jenkins@172.31.20.31

use slave private ip

step7: master node

sudo cp ~/.ssh/known_hosts  /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh

step8:
to view your private key

sudo cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa





vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
PasswordAuthentication Yes
systemctl restart sshd

use these command to create ssh
ssh-keygen
/root/.ssh/id_rsa
Your identification has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.

ssh-copy-id -i root@3.82.214.105
