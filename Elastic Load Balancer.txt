** Elastic Load Balancer -->
--------------------------------
- It is used to balance of trafic.
- It provides the Fault Tolarence and High Availability
	Fault Tolarence - It means, It sequares the network from any network fault/error.
	High Availability - It means, It runs or avilable the network in 24x7 times.

- Load Balancer distributes the web trafic to the available server.
- Load Balancer refers to efficient distributing incoming traffic across a group of backends server.
- For maintaing fault Tolarence and high availability we should create the EC2 Instance in multiple avalability zone.

** There are three types of Load Balancer --
1. Application Load Balancer :- 
	- If want get that our Mobile appication and desktop application are opened within minimum time  
	- It is worked on Application Layer of OSI Model.
	- It supports HTTP and HTTPS protocol.
2. Network Load Balancer :-
	- If we want to latency, like if we want get minimal response time then we should use Network Load Balancer.
	- It is worked on Transport Layer OSI Model.
	- It works on TCP, UDP and TLS Protocol.
3. Classic Load Balancer :- (Application Load Balancer + Network Load Balancer)
	- It is worked on Application and Transport Layers of OSI Model
	- It supports HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, UPD, and TLS Protocols



 ** Components of Load Balancer  --
-----------------------------------

1. Listner --
2. Target Group -- Target group is group of Instances 
3. Target -- EC2 Instance is called Target. 
		There are 3 types of Target --
		1. IP Based Target
		2. Lamda Based Target
		3. Instance Based Target
	When Target type is IP, you can use only following CIDR--
		1. 10.0.0.0/8
		2. 100.64.0.0/10
		3. 172.16.0.0/12
		4. 192.168.0.0/16
	You can't specify Public IP as Target IP.
