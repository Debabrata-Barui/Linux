** ** ps command in Linux ==>
As we all know Linux is a multitasking and multi-user systems. So, it allows multiple processes to operate simultaneously without interfering with each other. Process is one of the important fundamental concept of the Linux OS. A process is an executing instance of a program and carry out different tasks within the operating system. 

Linux provides us a utility called ps for viewing information related with the processes on a system which stands as abbreviation for “Process Status”. ps command is used to list the currently running processes and their PIDs along with some other information depends on different options. It reads the process information from the virtual files in /proc file-system. /proc contains virtual files, this is the reason it’s referred as a virtual file system. 

** top ==> top command is used to show the Linux processes. It provides a dynamic real-time view of the running system. Usually, this command shows the summary information of the system and the list of processes or threads which are currently managed by the Linux Kernel.


** Top vs Ps Command ==>
ps - (Process Status) - It reports a snapshot of current processes.
top (Table Of Processes) -It is a task manager program displays information about CPU and memory utilization.It provides a dynamic real-time view of the running system.

** How to kill the process in CentOS 7
# ps ==> Reports shell processes status
# top
# ps -elf ==> To display the running process in the terminal
# ps -elf |grep test1 ==> It finds the particular process which is running on the background .
# kill <process_id> ==> It is used to kill the process
Ex-
	# vim test1
	# ps -elf
	# ps -elf |grep test*
